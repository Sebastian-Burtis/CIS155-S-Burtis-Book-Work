                <body class="font">
                    Yoshikage Kira's backstory in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: Diamond is Unbreakable delves deeper
                    into his twisted psyche and the events that shaped his murderous tendencies.

                    Despite his seemingly normal upbringing, Kira's obsession with women's hands began at a young age.
                    This fixation grew into a compulsive desire to kill and collect the hands of his victims as
                    trophies. His ability to lead a double life, balancing his dark urges with the facade of a typical
                    salaryman, demonstrates his cunning and capacity for deception.
                    <br><br>
                    Kira's Stand, Killer Queen, becomes an integral part of his modus operandi. With Killer Queen's
                    power to turn anything it touches into a bomb, Kira can eliminate his victims discreetly and without
                    leaving evidence behind. This ability not only aids in his killings but also serves to heighten the
                    sense of danger and mystery surrounding him.

                    Despite his monstrous actions, Kira remains dedicated to maintaining his version of a peaceful life.
                    He meticulously chooses his victims, ensuring that their disappearances do not arouse suspicion.
                    Kira's meticulousness and attention to detail highlight his advanced planning skills and the lengths
                    he
                    will go to preserve his facade.
                    <br><br>
                    As the events of Diamond is Unbreakable unfold, Kira's backstory is gradually revealed, shedding
                    light on the depths of his depravity and the psychological complexities that drive him. His clashes
                    with the protagonists serve to unravel his carefully constructed facade, exposing the true nature of
                    his desires and motivations.

            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <h3>Killer Queen:</h3> Kira's Stand, Killer Queen, is a humanoid Stand with the ability to turn anything it
            touches into a bomb.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Primary Bomb:</h3> Killer Queen's primary ability allows it to turn any object or person it touches into
            a bomb, which detonates upon Kira's command. The explosion is powerful enough to obliterate its target.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Sheer Heart Attack:</h3> A sub-ability of Killer Queen, Sheer Heart Attack, takes the form of a small,
            indestructible tank-like object. It autonomously seeks out sources of heat and detonates upon contact,
            making it a formidable automatic weapon.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Bites the Dust:</h3> Killer Queen's ultimate ability, Bites the Dust, allows Kira to implant a bomb into
            a person. If anyone learns the secret identity of Kira from that person, time rewinds one hour, and that
            person is killed by an explosion, resetting the events of the past hour while leaving Kira unaffected.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Expertise in Disguise:</h3> Kira is highly skilled in disguising himself and altering his appearance,
            allowing him to evade detection by both authorities and Stand users.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Cunning and Manipulation:</h3> Kira is exceptionally intelligent and manipulative, able to carefully
            plan and execute his murders without drawing suspicion. He also uses psychological manipulation to control
            those around him and maintain his facade.
            <br><br>

            <h3>High Pain Tolerance:</h3> Kira has a high tolerance for pain, allowing him to endure injuries without
            flinching or showing signs of distress.
            <br><br>

            <h3>Obsessive Attention to Detail:</h3> Kira possesses an obsessive attention to detail, ensuring that his
            crimes are meticulously planned and executed to avoid detection.
